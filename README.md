### General Info

Created a progress bar that uses if statements to add and remove an active class, 
as well as to check against array.length to disable or enable previous and next buttons. 
Very simple and light CSS used for an animation and progress bar.

### Take-Away

What I got out of this project was in Javascript. Using incrementation, and if statements were a good practice.
Using .length and concatenating a percentage was very useful. I will definitely use this in future projects.
